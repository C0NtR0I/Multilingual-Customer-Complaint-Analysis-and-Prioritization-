# Multilingual-Customer-Complaint-Analysis-and-Prioritization-
# # Project Overview
🚀 Developed and implemented a comprehensive data analysis and machine learning pipeline to prioritize and analyze customer complaints for an innovative cloud services company.

Key Components
📊 Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing textual data, including translation, tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis: Extracting actionable insights on issue priority distribution, language detection, and description lengths.

🧠 Topic Modeling and Clustering: Applying Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling and K-means clustering to identify common themes and group similar complaints.

🤖 Machine Learning Models: Building and evaluating various classification models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM) to predict complaint priorities, with SVM achieving the highest accuracy and F1 score.

💡 Advanced Techniques: Exploring the potential of RNNs and LSTM models for further improvement in classification accuracy.
